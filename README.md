# TimeZone
Android app which displays the time in two different time zones.
There's absolutely nothing done on MainActivty.java, used only .xml files.
The time zones are : India and America
Tried using analog clock to make it fancy, but realized you have to change the clock hands manually using a handle, so i gave up :3
Please don't judge, Absolute beginner at this.
